## Documentation

### Grunt

A grunt build system has been added to this project. There are two build systems.

* Dev build (grunt dev) 
    - Cleans up any left over minified js files to pass JSHint.
    - Compiles **SASS** for files in css/sass in to single expanded **main.css**
    - Runs JSHint on all JS files, excluding files in the **"vendor"** directory
* Final build (grunt)
    - Compiles SASS for files in css/sass in to single minfied MAIN.CSS file.
    - Runs JSHint on all JS files, excluding files in the "vendor" directory.
    - Concatinates all JS files.
    - Uglifies concatinated js file.
    - Compresses JPG and PNG images.

**Use grunt watch:server to launch a livereload server. At the moment, this requires the [live reload](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242-how-do-i-install-and-use-the-browser-extensions-) Chrome extension.**

**Use @import to include any other .sccs files in to the final build. Compass only target _main.scss and its imports.**

### HTML5 Boilerplate

Take a look at the [documentation table of contents](doc/TOC.md). This
documentation is bundled with the project, which makes it readily available for
offline reading and provides a useful starting point for any documentation you
want to write about your project.


## To-do

* Add grunt support for compiling, minifying, uglifying, autoprefixing, and concatination
